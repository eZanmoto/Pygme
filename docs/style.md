Style Guide

### Style

+ Tabs are 4 whitespace characters.
+ There should be 2 blank lines between top-level functions and classes, and 1
  between methods in classes.
+ Docstrings should always be verbatim string literals. This will allow them to
  be extended to be multi-line comments without change.
+ Class definitions should always start with a docstring description, primarily
  so that the class can be folded via indentation in Vim.

Style Guide

### Style

+ Tabs are 4 whitespace characters.
+ There should be 2 blank lines between top-level functions and classes, and 1
  between methods in classes.
+ Docstrings should always be verbatim string literals. This will allow them to
  be extended to be multi-line comments without change.
+ When a list (parameter list or regular list) is placing one element per line,
  the first element should be on the line following the opening delimiter and
  indented by one tab. This allows for easier folding in vi than would be
  possible for lists where the elements are aligned with the opening delimiter.
